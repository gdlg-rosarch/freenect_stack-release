ros-kinetic-freenect-camera (0.2.1-0wily) wily; urgency=high

  * bumping version to 0.2.1
  * removed a bit of redundant code
  * if the device times out (aka no streams are produced for 5 seconds after request), then the device streams are flushed again. Repeat flushing typically fixes the problem. This is an experimental fix. closes #3 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/freenect_stack/issues/3>
  * enabled flushing the device streams at the start, which typically fixes the issue of device streams not starting with a cold start. #3 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/freenect_stack/issues/3>
  * the driver no longer acquires the device for the camera motor as that is not used
  * now install the nodelets file to the system package. closes #5 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/freenect_stack/issues/5>
  * fixing header references inside catkin packages for libfreenect (ros-drivers-gbp/libfreenect-release#3 <https://github.com/ros-drivers-gbp/libfreenect-release/issues/3>)
  * install node and nodelet
  * add maintainer, url links
  * clean up library references
  * use catkin version of dynamic parameter generator
  * partial catkin conversion of freenect_camera, still problems
  * fixed a few bugs instroduced while creating diagnostics
  * added diagnostics support to freenect_camera
  * added a debug flag to set the libfreenect log level. might be useful for remote debugging
  * changed header file location to refrain from patching libfreenect internally
  * removed redundant device shutdown call (done by FreenectDriver already)
  * reorganized stack for release
